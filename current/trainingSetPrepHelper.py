# features from cmu papers (2 axes accelerometer and light sensor used.)
# features were generated for 4 second windows, with 20 samples per second.
# 1. empirical mean: mean
# 2. rms: arithmetic mean of the squares of a group of values.
# 3. std deviation: square root( 1/N sum( (xi - mean)^2 )
# 4. variance: std-dev^2
# 5. mean absolute deviation: mean of absolute value of deviation from the mean, i.e. 1/N sum(abs(xi - mean)).
# 6. zero crossing rate: average number of times the measured value crosses zero.
# 7. mean crossing rate: average number of times the measured value crosses mean of the values.
# 8. cumulative histogram (256 bins): ?
# 9. nth percentile (n = 5, 10,...95): 
#    the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. 
# 10. Interquartile range.
#     In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle 50%, 
#     or technically H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, 
#     being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles,
#     IQR = Q3 âˆ’  Q1.
# 11. Sq of x^2, y^2
# 12. Decision Tree Classifier (18 nodes): ?
